# my_coach

This repository is my final project for ALX Software Engineering for Back-end Short Specialization.


This project is an application that stores athletes' information in order to store their data in a database. 

The data will be stored in a csv file and displayed in a
table form.

If it is your first time on the page, you first need to register as a user, however, not all users will have superuser rights, and cannot modify other users' events.

The app is split in three main pages: Events, Venues, and Members.

# Events page

The events page is the most important as it shows current events that will happen in the current month. A user can enter and see theirs and all other events, but cannot modify or delete an event that was not added by themselves.

# Venues page

The venues page shows where the events will be held. This is directly linked to events. Just as the user can add, modify and delete Events, so can the user do so with the 
Venues page.

# Athletes

This page, which can be accesssd directly on the Navbar called "Athletes," and it shows the athletes in the database.
